Really want to have an autoclicker that chases the button around the screen as well but I couldn't get that done in time for the first assignment

## What I've done so far

- Prompted brace and got some starter code with a clicker button that would try to escape the mouse as well as an automatic chaser that will catch the button and click it
- Fixed the buttons movement so it could be easier controlled with variables and also stops moving when not being pursued
- Tried to give the chasers a kick but their chasing was already a little broken and I still hadn't thought of a way for the button to escape corners
- Scrapped the chasers concept for the meantime to make a button that fit the requirements

## What I still need to do

- Fix kick effect so that if button is stuck in corner, it jumps past the chaser or mouse that's clicking
- add teleport kicker for a more consistent type of clicking that still has a physical effect
- Make main click button and counter look cool
- put together readouts for each auto clicker you have as well as average clicks(tags) per second
